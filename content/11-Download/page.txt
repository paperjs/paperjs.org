There are three ways to work with the latest development version in the <url https://github.com/paperjs/paper.js/tree/develop><code>develop</code></url> branch, the first two relying on automatic prebuilding after each commit:

- Point NPM or Bower to specific commits in the <url https://github.com/paperjs/paper.js/tree/prebuilt/module><code>prebuilt/module</code></url> branch
- Download the latest packaged ZIP file from the <url https://github.com/paperjs/paper.js/tree/prebuilt/dist><code>prebuilt/dist</code></url> branch
- Check out the latest version from the <url https://github.com/paperjs/paper.js/tree/develop><code>develop</code></url> branch and build it yourself, following the instructions in the <url https://github.com/paperjs/paper.js/blob/develop/README.md><code>README</code></url> file.
